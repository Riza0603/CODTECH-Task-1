**Objective:**


This application aims to be a user-friendly tool that helps users:

* Improve organization and task management by creating and maintaining a list of tasks.
* Enhance productivity by breaking down goals into smaller tasks and providing a visual representation of the to-do list.
* Increase efficiency by allowing users to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete, helping them prioritize work and manage time effectively.
* Gain a sense of accomplishment by seeing completed tasks checked off the list, motivating them to keep moving forward.


**Technologies Used:**

* **HTML:** Defines the structure of the web page, including the input box, button, and list container.
* **CSS:** Styles the visual elements of the application, such as the background color, fonts, and layout.
* **JavaScript:** Provides interactivity, allowing users to add tasks, mark them complete, and remove them. Uses local storage to persist data across page reloads.


**User Interface (UI) Elements:**

* **Input Box:** Users enter new tasks here.
* **Add Button:** Clicking this button adds the task to the list.
* **Task List:** Displays all entered tasks.
* **Task Items:** Individual tasks displayed in the list.
* **Checkbox:** Clicking on a task's checkbox marks it as complete (strikethrough text).
* **Delete Button:** Clicking the delete button removes a task from the list.
  
**Functionality:**

1. **Adding Tasks:** Users enter a task description in the input box and press Enter or click the "Add" button.
2. **Displaying Tasks:** Entered tasks are displayed dynamically in the list container.
3. **Marking Tasks Complete:** Clicking on a task's checkbox applies a strikethrough style to mark it as complete.
4. **Removing Tasks:** Clicking the delete button removes a task from the list.
5. **Filtering Tasks:** Users can filter tasks by "Completed" or "Incomplete".
6. **Deleting All Tasks:** Users can delete all tasks in one action using the "Delete All" button.
